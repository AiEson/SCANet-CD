## Usage
### Requirements
1. Create a conda environment with python 3.11.
    ```Bash
    conda create -n YourEnvName python=3.11
    ```
2. Activate the environment.
    ```Bash
    conda activate YourEnvName
    ```
3. Clone the repository and change the directory.
   ```Bash
   git clone https://github.com/AiEson/SCANet-CD.git
   cd SCANet
   ```
4. Install the dependencies.
   ```Bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Training
#### Dataset Preparation
1. WHU Dataset: http://gpcv.whu.edu.cn/data/Building%20change%20detection%20dataset_add.zip
---
#### Run the following command to train the model.
- For WHU Dataset:
  ```Bash
  bash scripts/SCANet_whu.sh
  ```


## The Core Code of SCANet
We utilized the [Segmentation Models](https://segmentation-models-pytorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library as our segmentation model repository and made modifications to its source code to adapt it to our model.

The modified code is placed in the `models/my_smp/` directory, with implementations of various encoders located under the `models/my_smp/encoders/` directory. We implemented SCANet in the [`models/my_smp/encoders/scanet.py`](https://github.com/AiEson/SCANet-CD/blob/main/models/my_smp/encoders/scanet.py) file, enabling easy replacement of the decoder without any modifications to the decoder.

### Call SCANet Model Anywhere
```Python
import models.my_smp as smp
# UNet as the decoder
model = smp.Unet(
   encoder_name='scanet-101e',
   classes=1,
   encoder_weights=None,
   in_channels=3
)
# UNet++ as the decoder
model = smp.UnetPlusPlus(
   encoder_name='scanet-101e',
   classes=1,
   encoder_weights=None,
   in_channels=3
)
```

### Models and Params
‚ö†Ô∏è: The parameters of SCANet are twice that of the original model because SCANet-CD is a dual-branch network (which has two encoders, and concats the features of the two encoders in the decoder).

| **Encoder Name** | **Params(M)** |
|------------------|---------------|
| scanet-14d       | 34*2            |
| scanet-26d       | 40.5*2          |
| scanet-50d       | 50.9*2          |
| scanet-101e      | 73.2*2          |
